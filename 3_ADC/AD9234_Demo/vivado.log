INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:ila:6.2-6] /ila_0: Xilinx recommends using the System ILA IP in IP Integrator. The System ILA IP is functionally equivalent to an ILA and offers additional benefits in debugging interfaces both within IP Integrator and the Hardware Manager. Consult the Programming and Debug User Guide UG908 for further details.
